# Roadmap

## Packaging the Code

Not all of the code is properly tangled.
Also, it's not 100% clear how it ought to be packaged for import.
Then, the code should be properly tested.

## Figures

The code should generate the figures.
Basic support for binary trees is available, but not fully packaged.
