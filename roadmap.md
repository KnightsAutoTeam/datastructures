# Roadmap

## The missing pieces

There are several parts of the text that have not been written.
A partial list includes:
- Variations on the OrderedList implementation
- The WBTree analysis
- HeapSort and the sorting lower bound
- Kruskall's MST algorithm


## Figures

The code should generate the figures.
Basic support for arrays and binary trees is available, but not fully packaged.
